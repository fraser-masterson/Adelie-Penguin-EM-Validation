# Adelie Penguin EM Validation
Code used to:
1. Clean and classify diving behaviours of Adélie penguins using an Expectation Maximisation model.
2. Validate the classifications of the Expectation Maximisation model following frame-based annotation in VANTAGE.
3. Build generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) from the validation outputs to build probabilistic prediction frameworks.
